# Quick-division

This program speeds up the division in certain cases, e.g. if our 1st number is a very large number and the 2nd is relatively small, then the program writes the large number as a smaller number and if it is divisible by the 2nd number, then our 1st number can also be divided will be with the 2nd number, if not, then the 2nd number will not be divisible by the 1st either!
